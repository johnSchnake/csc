We guarantee all teams 3 games. Valuing your family time and aiming to get you home early on a Sunday, we plan to use a round robin format with 4 team flights. The top team after 3 games will be declared the winners and receive the Pirate Cup. There will be no finals. We will also have awards for teams displaying sportsmanship throughout the event!

We would be delighted to welcome you to the 2023 Pirate Cup, held April 1st & 2nd in Lake Charles. Our club aims to provide you, your team and fans with a thoroughly enjoyable experience! One that brings out the best in sportsmanship and competition on and off the field!
