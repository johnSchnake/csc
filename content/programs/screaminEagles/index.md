Our purpose is to introduce the cutest generation to the great game of soccer through fun activities and games. The focus will be on gross motor skill development such as running, jumping and balance, and a basic introduction to soccer fundamentals such as kicking and dribbling.

 - 50 minute fun activities will take place on five Saturday mornings at the Lake Charles Power Center Sports Complex, during both the Fall & Spring soccer seasons.
 - CSC t-shirt (to be provided by CSC), shorts, socks, shin guards should be worn. Soccer cleats are not required.
 - A parent or guardian is required to be present for all activities which will be facilitated by CSC coaches.
 - Registration fee is $65 which includes t-shirt.

## Season Dates
Fall: September-October / Spring: March-April. Exact dates TBA
Time
9:00am or 10:00am

## Location
The Power Center Complex, 3200 Power Center Pkwy, Lake Charles. A field plan will be posted prior to the season.

## Equipment

Please have your little soccer player wear their Screamin’ Eagles T-Shirt ( to be picked up at a parent meeting a week before the start of the season), shorts & socks (any color), shin guards, cleats or sneakers. We will have soccer balls but recommend bringing your own SIZE 3 ball. Put a name on it in case it gets lost. Bring water and post-game snacks for your little kickers.

## Parent/Guardian Participation
CSC soccer coaches will lead the activities, but we will be requiring that a parent or guardian remain on site and even participate (YIKES!) throughout the session.

## Parent Meeting
A brief parent meeting will be held by the Power Center concessions stand just prior to the season where parents can pick up their child’s t-shirt and receive a little more information ahead of the first day.
We can’t wait to meet the next generation of soccer superstars!
