### Age Requirement

Refer to the [AGE MATRIX](resources/AGE-MATRIX-2016-2024-1.pdf) to check your age group.

Please note age groups now follow the Calendar Year rather than the School Year. If players wish to request to play with up in age with friends they should be aware of possible difference in field sizes and older teammates/opponents which may not provide them with the best experience. We apologize but this is a nationwide change implemented by US Soccer in 2016. 

## Ordering Uniforms
