## About

Buddy Ball is a soccer program for children with learning disabilities, and/or physical disabilities. Each buddy ball athlete has a buddy to guide them through the soccer activities, and help them enjoy the experience as much as possible. Some BB athletes may be in a wheelchair and need to be pushed, while some very little help and direction. This past season they had between 25 - 30 BB athletes at each session, so they need that many volunteer buddies.

The activities take place at the Ward 3 Power Center soccer fields, and are facilitated by Paul Burgess <paul@cscsoccerclub.org> - reach out to him with specific questions.

## Season Information

- **Dates:** TBD
