**WELCOME! NO EXPERIENCE IS NECESSARY!**

Coaching requires patience, passion, and a love for kids and the game of soccer. If you can spare time enough to coach 1 or 2 practices per week plus a Saturday morning game, we would be delighted to have you become part of CSC. We provide balls, cones & bibs and offer guidance and resources.

Coaching in our Recreation program is extremely important to the success of the club as a whole. It is the first experience many players will have with the great game of soccer, and we appreciate and value the time and commitment that coaches make developing our young players.  Coaches are more than just a teacher of the sport. They are a mentor, tasked with developing not only fundamental soccer skills but also teaching the value of teamwork, sportsmanship and integrity.

Click 'Resources' below for information that coaches may find useful in becoming the best coach they can be such as:
 - Lesson plans by age
 - Rules
 - Coach's Guide
 - Safety training
 - External coaching resources
 - and more!
