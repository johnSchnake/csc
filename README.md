# Calcasieu Parish Soccer Club Website

This repository hosts the content for the Calcasieu Soccer Club.
It is currently hosted at calcasieusoccerclub.netlify.app and is under construction. The existing site exists at http://cscsoccerclub.org

## Updating the Site

### Modifying an Existing Page

### Adding or Removing New Pages

### Adding or Removing Options on the Landing Page

### Adding or Removing Options on the Menu or Footer

### Changing Colors or Minor Visuals

### Changing Pictures

### Adding/Removing Advertiser Logos

### Limitations

In general, modifying the site in the ways listed above are very easy and do not require much expertise.
Some changes however would potentially require more developer experience.
Listed below are some cases which, although possible, would likely require developer experience:

 - Changing the number of buttons for programs
 - Changing the general look and feel of the site in non-trivial ways

## TODO

 - [x] adjust buttons in list to be vertically aligned on the side? Already centered so maybe ok.
 - [ ] Fill in copy from existing site
 - [ ] Advertiser logos
 - [x] Alternate background color for items in list
 - [ ] Pictures for all the programs?
 - [ ] Simple way to make announcements?
